As far as the author knows, XLIFF file translations is a niche problem specific to Microsoft Business Central extension development, and as such we do not expect this project to raise much interest.

However, if anyone wants to contribute in any way, please contact us and we will work out something.

And of course, issue reports and feature suggestions are most welcome.
